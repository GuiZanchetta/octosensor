- Solve ESP32 / Big Sur OS conflict: NOT solved yet, lots of ESP and Python updates later. Momentary solution: use parallels and Windows Arduino IDE.

DAY 2

- Test of the (Wemos Lolin32) "Esp32 Oled - Esp32 + Wifi + Bluetooth Dual Core Esp". It has an integrated OLED display, so it's less soldering also. I hope this will not conflict with the laser sensor as it was in the early tests.
