DAY 1
09 january 2021

- Solve ESP32 / Big Sur OS conflict: NOT solved yet, lots of ESP and Python updates later. Momentary solution: use parallels and Windows Arduino IDE.
- Instructions followed (but didn't work): https://www.reddit.com/r/esp32/comments/jtgpc0/cant_compile_anything_since_upgrading_to_big_sur/

DAY 2
10 january 2021

- Test of the (Wemos Lolin32) 
"Esp32 Oled - Esp32 + Wifi + Bluetooth Dual Core Esp". 
It has an integrated OLED display, so it's less soldering and connections in the project. I hope this will not conflict with the laser sensor as it was in the early tests. 

>>>>> WeMos Lolin 32 HAD THE SAME DELAY PROBLEM READING TFMINI SENSOR. SO BACK TO USING ESP + OLED + ARDUINO NANO (only for TFMini readings)





- Assemble prototypes for S01(Sensor 01) and C00 (Central 00)

- Test two way communication using ESP NOW (wireless comm protocol) between S01 and C00
